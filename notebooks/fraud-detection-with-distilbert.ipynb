    "**Problem**\n",
    "Earlier runs achieved only ~81% accuracy, far below the target 93%.\n",
    "**Causes**\n",
    "1. Class Imbalance: The initial model (81.22%) was biased toward legitimate transactions, with 0.17 fraud recall.\n",
    "2. Checkpoint Mismatch: Evaluating checkpoint-296 on the feature-engineered dataset (64.13%) failed due to dataset incompatibility.\n",
    "3. Training Instability: The first weighted loss attempt (64.81%) suffered from suboptimal convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixes**\n",
    "1. Weighted Loss: Applied 10x weight to fraud cases, improving fraud recall to 0.76.\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering: Included V1–V8, enabling the model to capture richer patterns.\n",
    "3. Retraining: Retrained on the feature-engineered dataset, achieving 92.89% accuracy.\n",
    "4. Consistent Random Seeds: Used random_state=42 for reproducibility.\n",
